Get more newsLiveonPrintJuly 1, 2024, 3:16 AM UTCBy Mike Memoli and Monica AlbaWASHINGTON — As top Democrats offered a public show of support for President Joe Biden throughout the weekend, his advisers worked privately Sunday to push back against suggestions that he step aside, with his campaign manager describing the mechanics of replacing him on the ticket as messy and impractical. During a tense call with a group of about 40 of Biden’s top financial backers, campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez laid out what could and could not be done with the campaign’s infrastructure if Biden were to step aside while emphasizing throughout the call that he had no intention of doing so.Most of the campaign’s significant war chest would fall to Vice President Kamala Harris, Chavez Rodriguez said, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Only a smaller pool of money would be kept by the Democratic National Committee.As several donors posited what a participant derisively referred to as fanciful “West Wing”-type scenarios for replacing Biden, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who joined for part of the call, emphasized that the process would be “messy” and predicted that Harris would ultimately end up as the nominee.Sunday’s call was just one of a series of similar conversations top Biden advisers and campaign leaders have been holding with Democratic officials and donors after Biden’s halting debate performance rattled the party elite. The conversation was among the more candid the campaign has held with a larger group in recent days, wading into the delicate question of exactly who might succeed Biden if he were to step aside.Jen O'Malley Dillon, the chair of the Biden campaign, is also set to hold a call with a larger group of donors Monday night, according to two sources familiar with the plans. President Joe Biden speaks on the phone while walking from Marine One at McGuire Air Force Base, N.J., on Saturday.Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Biden’s family — the people who have most influence on him — met and discussed the future of his campaign during a long-planned gathering at Camp David, Maryland, NBC News first reported.  The message from Biden’s children and grandchildren, together for a photo shoot Sunday with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, was to “keep fighting,” said two sources familiar with the discussions. In recent days, some of Biden’s family members have expressed deep frustration with the aides and advisers responsible for preparing him for the debate, which carried over into conversations over the weekend, multiple sources said. A senior Biden adviser called such suggestions false, while a campaign spokesperson said Biden still has confidence in his most senior staffers. “The aides who prepped the President have been with him for years, often decades, seeing him through victories and challenges. He maintains strong confidence in them,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.  The campaign’s public posture Sunday was to draw attention to the positive, or at least neutral, response that voters and grassroots supporters have had to Biden’s first debate against former President Donald Trump.“Every time Donald Trump opened his mouth, those dials dropped. They just absolutely plummeted,” Biden campaign pollster Molly Murphy said on MSNBC, referring to live panels the campaign conducted Thursday. “[Voters] felt like the president came across as someone who cares about middle- and working-class Americans, and when compared to Trump he came across as more presidential, more likable, more truthful.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in another MSNBC interview: “It certainly was a setback. But of course I believe a setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback.” During the call with donors, Chavez Rodriguez noted that the campaign has raised $33 million since the debate and even received hundreds of new applications from people wanting to join the campaign.  Coons also made a “fiery” case for Biden, pointing to his performance during recent international gatherings and his campaign rally in North Carolina on Friday to say there’s no evidence that Thursday’s debate was anything other than a bad night. One participant said that many on the call were still firmly behind Biden but that “a lot of the participants are frightened.” “There were some tough comments from those on the call. Some were upset that they are just hearing campaign talking points,” the participant said, adding that some donors even asked about having their contributions refunded.Another senior Democratic official who has spoken directly with Biden and members of his campaign team said he has been reassured about Biden’s staying in the race and characterized his team’s posture as “powering through.”But he also said he has had a lot of “one-off texts and conversations” with his peers and predicted the next two weeks would be critical.“We’ll have polls and we’ll have a money count. If they’re good, it leans that he [remains in the race]. And if it’s not, all bets are off,” the official said. It will be “decided on data more than emotion. It’s too early to make the call.”Mike MemoliMike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent. Monica AlbaMonica Alba is a White House correspondent for NBC News.Carol E. Lee and Jonathan Allen contributed."

But this is Simone Biles we're talking about.   For Biles, at 27 already the most decorated gymnast in history, a somewhat shaky night at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials was still enough to finish ahead of her competitors by more than 5.5 points — and officially secure a place on the team that will compete at this summer's games in Paris.   \n    \n\n    \n\n\n   And the crowd didn't mind the slip-ups. After her floor routine, her final event of the night, Biles walked off the podium to a standing ovation from the 16,000 people packed into the stands of the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis.   \n            \n                           \n                        Sports \n            With the Olympics fast approaching, gymnast Simone Biles already looks dominant\n         \n         \n\n      \n      \n\n   \n   \n\n   Olympic gold is the next capstone that awaits Biles's remarkable return to dominance after a two-year hiatus from competition. In 2021, she was forced to withdraw from several events in Tokyo after experiencing the \"twisties,\" a psychological phenomenon in which a gymnast loses their ability to control their body in mid-air. The two-year break, she has said, was necessary to tend to her mental health.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Simone Biles was all smiles after her vault performance on Friday on the first day of the Olympic gymnastics trials in Minneapolis. She easily outqualified all of her competitors to make her third Olympic squad.\n                \n                    \n                    Russell Lewis/NPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n        \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Russell Lewis/NPR\n        \n    \n\n   \n   \"I never pictured going to another Olympic Games after Tokyo, just because of the circumstances. I never thought I would go back in the gym again, be twisting, feel free,\" Biles said Sunday after the competition.    Biles will enter the Olympics in Paris as a favorite to win gold medals in the individual all-around, vault and floor exercise.   In Paris, she will be joined by the Tokyo Games all-around gold medalist Suni Lee, the St. Paul native who shone Sunday night in front of the friendly hometown crowd.    Two other Olympic veterans, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey, will return for their second Games. Rounding out the team is newcomer Hezly Rivera, who turned 16 in June. Two alternates, Joscelyn Roberson and Leanne Wong, will also travel with the team.    \n            \n                           \n                        Sports \n            Simone Biles has won her 9th all-around national championship\n         \n         \n\n      \n      \n\n   \n   \n\n   The women's team had won gold in the team all-around in 2012 and 2016. But in Tokyo, they came in second place after Biles withdrew from the event.    That silver medal finish has stuck with them, the competitors said Sunday. All four of those returning to the Olympics used the word \"redemption\" as they talked about their goals for Paris.    \"I feel like we all have more to give. Our Tokyo performances weren't the best,\" Biles said. \"We weren't under the best circumstances, either, but I feel like we have a lot of weight on our shoulders to go out there and prove we're better athletes.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                On the opening vault of the women's competition in Minneapolis on Friday, Kayla DiCello landed awkwardly. She crumpled to the mat and was carried off. She later revealed she ruptured her Achilles tendon and withdrew from competition.\n                \n                    \n                    Russell Lewis/NPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n        \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Russell Lewis/NPR\n        \n    \n\n   \n   Injuries had loomed over the women's trials   A spate of injuries ahead of and on the first day of competition had cast a pall over the women's trials. First came an Achilles injury to Skye Blakely during pre-competition training on Wednesday; Blakely's second-place finish at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships had lifted her stock for a possible Olympic nod.   \n    \n\n    \n\n\n   Then, on Friday, Shilese Jones, another favorite to make the Paris squad, tweaked her knee as she warmed up on the vault. Minutes later, a third gymnast, Kayla DiCello, was forced to leave the competition in a wheelchair after hurting her Achilles on the vault.   \n            \n                           \n                        Live Updates: The Tokyo Olympics \n            Simone Biles Got The 'Twisties' At The Tokyo Olympics. Here's What That Means\n         \n         \n\n      \n      \n\n   \n   \n\n   The back-to-back injuries Friday rattled the remaining competitors. Lee, who was in line to vault immediately after DiCello, had to wipe tears before stepping onto the podium.   \"I had to meet with my therapist yesterday and try to get my mind right, because it was just so devastating to see a couple of my friends get taken out of this huge competition,\" Lee said Sunday. \"My heart is with them.\"   The U.S. men's gymnastics team head to Paris hoping to win first team medal since 2008   The men's team was announced Saturday night. The five competitors, led by Olympic veteran Brody Malone and newcomer (and social media star) Fred Richard, head to Paris with the goal of winning the first U.S. team medal in gymnastics since 2008.   \"We shouldn't even be aiming for just a medal. We should be aiming for gold, and we're going to land on something,\" Richard said Saturday.   \n            \n                           \n                        Sports \n            Women's gymnastics is changing in more ways than one\n         \n         \n\n      \n      \n\n   \n   \n\n   Richard, 20, scored the highest total at the U.S. team trials, while Malone, 24, finished in second place. They will be joined in Paris by Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Stephen Nedoroscik, along with alternates Shane Wiskus and Khoi Young.   A secondary goal for the team — besides a return to the team medal podium — is simply to raise the profile of men's gymnastics, a sport that has long been overshadowed by its women's counterpart.   \"If we go into Paris and get a team medal like we've been training for, then it's going to set even more fuel on that fire,\" Hong said Saturday.\n\n\n      \n            Facebook\n      Flipboard\n      Email\n   \n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n      \n         \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
